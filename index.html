			<h3>About Me</h3>
			<p>Hi, my name is Jason Guaschino. I am student at <a href="https://www.njit.edu/" target="_blank" >NJIT</a> and am currently enrolled in NJIT's <a href="https://www.njit.edu/academics/major/information-technology" target="_blank">Information Technology</a> undergraduate program. I am hoping to graduate by the summer of 2021. I am a full time student and am using my veterans education benefits to take this oppurtunity to change careers paths. <br><br>I have most recently been studying several coding languages at NJIT and have a very basic knowledge of the following languages:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>HTML</li>
				<li>CSS</li>
				<li>Java</li>
				<li>Python</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Background</h3>
			<p>I am originally from New Jersey. I joined the U.S. Army in 1998 and served for seven years as a Bradley Fighting Vehicle (BFV) Systems Operations Technician. After my career in the Army I worked in the field of government contracting as a cosultant to the military for the BFV. Unfortunatley my career required quite a bit of travel and I was frequently calleed away from my family for months at a time. Due to this and many other reasons I decided that I was no longer happy with my career choice which is what led me to where I am now.</p>
